## Manifesto ðŸ“œ

### 1. Master the Moment

> Yesterday is history, tomorrow a mystery and today is a gift. That is why it is called the present â€” Master Oogway
>

No amount of money ever bought anyone another second of time. Yes, planning for the future and learning about our history is important, but inconsequential to what we choose to do now. The only history that matters, is the history we make today.

### 2. Knowledge Starts With n

> The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination â€” Albert Einstein
>

Having a lot of experience with a subject can make you an expert but itâ€™ll be that child-like imagination and courage to dare to try the impossible, that'll change the world.
