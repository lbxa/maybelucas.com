## Bio

Growing up in Brazil, I got expelled from every school and it wasn’t until I watched [The Social Network](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/) after moving to Sydney that I taught myself to code in PHP.

My maths teachers claimed I was too late to join the [4 Unit Maths class](https://curriculum.nsw.edu.au/learning-areas/mathematics/mathematics-extension-2-11-12-2024/overview), so I topped the class until they had no choice but to let me enrol. Then I co-founded the school's first Mathematics club alongside my friend [Stefan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%F0%9F%8C%B1-stefan-gazzana-17a102141/) teaching accelerated maths to the next generation of students.

Despite being suspended twice and almost being asked to leave my last school, I worked hard to turn things around and got elected as house house captain by popular vote.

Ended up studying Eng/CompSci at UNSW (hated Eng) and now fast-forward to 2025, and I’m working on buiding a consumer AI software company and seeking a path to scaling robotics and fusion.
