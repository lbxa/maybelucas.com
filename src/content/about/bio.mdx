## Bio

Growing up in Brazil, I was basically expelled from every school for misbehaviour. It wasn’t until I watched [The Social Network](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/) whilst living in Sydney where I got my life together and taught myself to code in PHP.

When my high school maths teachers told me I was too late to join the [4 Unit Maths class](https://curriculum.nsw.edu.au/learning-areas/mathematics/mathematics-extension-2-11-12-2024/overview), I topped my class until they had no choice but to let me in. Then I co-founded the school's first Mathematics club alongside [my friend Stefan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%F0%9F%8C%B1-stefan-gazzana-17a102141/).

Despite being suspended twice in year 7 and almost being asked to leave this school, I got elected as Mutien house captain on popular vote, and we won the swimming carnival that year.

Now it's 2025, and I’m trying to build a consumer software company and trying to find a path to scaling robotics and fusion.
