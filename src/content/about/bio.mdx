Hey I'm Lucas.

I'm a *software engineer*,

*researcher* and 

*product designer*. 
<br />

If you're here, then let's [chat](https://cal.com/lucas-barbosa-8c6ajd). Here's what I've been up to during undergrad:

## Bio

I grew up in Brazil, got expelled from school for standing up from myself, moved to Sydney, watched [The Social Network](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/), and taught myself to code in PHP. Got elected house captain, forced my way into [4-Unit Maths](https://curriculum.nsw.edu.au/learning-areas/mathematics/mathematics-extension-2-11-12-2024/overview) by topping all my classes, then co-founded the school’s first maths club with my friend [Stefan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%F0%9F%8C%B1-stefan-gazzana-17a102141/) to teach accelerated content to the next generation of students.

Ended up studying Eng/CS at UNSW (only place that offered it) and now fast-forward to 2025, I’m working on building a [consumer AI software company](https://onexhq.com/) and seeking a path to scaling robotics and fusion.
