## Bio

Growing up in Brazil, I was basically expelled from all my schools. It wasn’t until I watched [The Social Network](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/) while living in Sydney that I got my life together and taught myself to code in PHP to build a bunch of websites.

When my high school maths teachers told me I was too late to join the [4 Unit Maths class](https://curriculum.nsw.edu.au/learning-areas/mathematics/mathematics-extension-2-11-12-2024/overview), I topped my class until they had no choice but to let me in. Then I co-founded the school's first Mathematics club alongside my friend [Stefan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%F0%9F%8C%B1-stefan-gazzana-17a102141/).

Despite being suspended twice in year 7 and almost being asked to leave this school, I got elected as house house captain by popular vote, and we won the swimming carnival that year.

Fast-forward to 2025, and I’m working on buiding a consumer AI software company and seeking a path to scaling robotics and fusion.
