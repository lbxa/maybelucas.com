## Bio

I grew up in Brazil, got expelled from every school, moved to Sydney, watched [The Social Network](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/), and taught myself to code PHP. I turned it around, was elected house captain, forced my way into [4-Unit Maths](https://curriculum.nsw.edu.au/learning-areas/mathematics/mathematics-extension-2-11-12-2024/overview) by topping all my classes, then co-founded the school’s first maths club with my friend [Stefan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%F0%9F%8C%B1-stefan-gazzana-17a102141/) to teach accelerated content to the next generation of students.

Studying Eng/CompSci at UNSW (only place that offered it) and now fast-forward to 2025, I’m working on building a [consumer AI software company](https://onexhq.com/) and seeking a path to scaling robotics and fusion.
