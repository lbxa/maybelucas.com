Humanoids. Fusion. Software.

These three elements are all the primitives we need to unlock limitless energy and labour.

What will we do once labour is plentiful and cheap? Humanoids will be powered by virtually unlimited fusion supplies and controlled by the discrete art of artificial general intelligence.

Will we work? Or will we buy $20k humanoids to do the work for us?

Will everyone go back to being a farmer?

How will cities change?

What happens to companies?

Do humans now just drink mojitos on their UBI budgets?

I think we’re gonna need a new wave of philosophers who are up for the task for navigating the ambiguity of this miraculous future that doesn’t feel so far away.
