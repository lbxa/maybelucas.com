description: The fitness industry is broken.

Skeleton bodies, Giga Chad chests, iced matchas. Copy-pasted workout and nutrition plans. Unsubstantiated promises of a new-year-new-me body.

The industry can only pretend that these band-aids lower the barrier of entry for the average human.

If anything it’s increasing - that same superficiality on social media that’s rewired everyone’s brains to be the skinniest or the one with the most friends has corrupted the fitness and health industry.

Now add Big Pharma, whose incentive is to keep you medicated instead of actually preventing chronic illness with something as cheap and as easy as 30 mins of exercise every day.

At oNex it’s going to be our job to successfully scale fitness. To every human. On earth.

No one has achieved this. No fitness app has ever hit 1 billion users. We will. Be. The. First.

Social media is all about optics.

oNex is all about movement.

Big pharma wants to continue manufacturing medication.

oNex will just release the antidote.
