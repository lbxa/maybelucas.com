description: I often feel a wave of existential dread when I imagine a post-AGI world. Writing helps me wrestle with that fear. Below is a poem that expresses my anxiety and hope for a future where humans and AGI move forward together in harmony. Hopefully you enjoy it.

A young engineer sits in silence,

eyes haunted by futures of empty hands.

Factories hushed, offices hollow,

a world stripped of work, stripped of worth.

<div style={{margin: '3rem 0'}}></div>

But history whispers through the dread:

When the plow carved Earth,

farmers did not vanish, fields multiplied.

When the elevator rose,

cities touched the sky.

When the calculator ticked,

minds leapt toward deeper riddles.

<div style={{margin: '3rem 0'}}></div>

Innovation births not an ending,

but doors we cannot yet see.

Fear remains, yet fear is fuel.

Together we march, not into ruin,

but into the unknown promise of progress.

<div style={{margin: '3rem 0'}}></div>

And suddenly the weight lifts

What if this could work?

What if abundance is the next frontier?

No longer shackled to laborâ€™s grind,

we might chase questions that

cannot be answered by machines.

<div style={{margin: '3rem 0'}}></div>

For the answer is simple: 42

but the purpose is not.

Our charge in a post-AGI dawn

is not to end the search for meaning,

but to ask, with renewed courage:

What is the right question?
