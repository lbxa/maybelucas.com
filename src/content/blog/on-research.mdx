Be bold. Be ambitious. Have courage.

Most research doesn't move the needle. The world needs less iterative refinement and more outlandish ideas. People often say ideas are abundant and execution is key. That is only partly true. Great ideas are still ultra scarce. However there are 1 million ways to drastically improve society if you choose to look in the right places. 

Leave the simulator.

Energy production can always be cheaper and more abundant. Robots can be smarter and more useful. Factories can be bigger. Materials can be smarter. Batteries can be cheaper. There is work to do. This list doesn't end.

Godspeed
