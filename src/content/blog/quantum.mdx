## States

Quantum states live in vector spaces, represented by bras and kets:
$$
\bra{a} = (a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n),\qquad
\ket{b} = \begin{pmatrix}b_1\\b_2\\ \vdots \\ b_n\end{pmatrix}.
$$
This Dirac notation elegantly captures the structure of quantum states.

An operator $\bold M$ acting on a ket satisfies
$$
\bold M\ket{\lambda} = \lambda\,\ket{\lambda},
$$
where $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue and $\ket{\lambda}$ is its eigenvector.

## Observability

Observables correspond to Hermitian operators:
$$
\bold L = \bold L^{\dagger}.
$$
For a Hermitian operator,
$$
\bold L\ket{\lambda} = \lambda\ket{\lambda},
\quad
\bra{\lambda}\bold L^{\dagger} = \lambda^*\bra{\lambda}.
$$
Then
$$
\bra{\lambda}\bold L\ket{\lambda}
= \lambda\,\braket{\lambda|\lambda}
= \bra{\lambda}\bold L^{\dagger}\ket{\lambda}
= \lambda^*\,\braket{\lambda|\lambda}.
$$
Since $\bold L=\bold L^{\dagger}$ and $\braket{\lambda|\lambda}\neq0$, it follows that $\lambda=\lambda^*$; hence, observables yield **real** values.

> Observable and measurable quantities are represented by Hermitian operators.

## Measurements

> The possible outcomes of measuring an observable $\bold L$ are its eigenvalues $\{\lambda_i\}$. If the system is in eigenstate $\ket{\lambda_i}$, the measurement result is guaranteed to be $\lambda_i$.

Given an initial state $\ket{\Psi(0)}$, its time evolution is governed by a unitary operator $\bold U(t)$:
$$
\ket{\Psi(t)} = \bold U(t)\ket{\Psi(0)},
\qquad
\bold U^{\dagger}(t)\,\bold U(t) = I.
$$
Unitarity preserves inner products, separating quantum dynamics from classical intuition:

| Classical | State and measurement coincide. |
| --- | --- |
| Quantum | State evolution (via $\bold U$) and measurement (via $\bold L$) are distinct. |

After evolving to $\ket{A}$, measuring $\bold L$ yields probabilities
$$
P(\lambda_i)
= \braket{A|\lambda_i}\,\braket{\lambda_i|A}\,.
$$

> If $\ket{A}$ is the post-evolution state, the probability of obtaining $\lambda_i$ upon measuring $\bold L$ is $P(\lambda_i)=\braket{A|\lambda_i}\braket{\lambda_i|A}$.

## Energy and Time Evolution

For an infinitesimal interval $\epsilon$, unitarity requires
$$
\bold U^{\dagger}(\epsilon)\,\bold U(\epsilon) = I.
$$
Expanding to first order,
$$
\bold U(\epsilon) = I - i\epsilon\,\bold H,
\quad
\bold U^{\dagger}(\epsilon) = I + i\epsilon\,\bold H^{\dagger}.
$$
Applying this to the state,
$$
\ket{\Psi(\epsilon)} = (I - i\epsilon\,\bold H)\ket{\Psi(0)},
$$
leads to
$$
\frac{\ket{\Psi(\epsilon)} - \ket{\Psi(0)}}{\epsilon}
= -i\,\bold H\,\ket{\Psi(0)},
$$
which in the limit $\epsilon\to0$ becomes the time‑dependent Schrödinger equation:
$$
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\ket{\Psi(t)} = \bold H\,\ket{\Psi(t)}.
$$
