title: Is the Law of Entropy Self-Evident?

Systems naturally move towards states with the maximum possible entropy, where energy is uniformly spread out 
and less available for useful work. Higher entropy also means a larger configuration of possible microscopic 
states. In this case, a system will have more disordered arrangements driven by statistical likelihood — 
*more possibilities*.

It’s important to note this doesn’t contradict the principle of minimum energy, where excited systems, 
once left to rest, will attempt to return to their ground state. This very example already 
**violates the second** law as an excited system is not a **closed system**. Energy has been added 
to it. However the surroundings will absorb the increased entropy, that’s the point. Take all the 
entropy contained in the universe, it will only continue to increase.
