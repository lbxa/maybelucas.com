Breaking large insurmountable tasks into smaller manageable subtasks enables hyper-productivity. I found that completing a high volume of small tasks results in a larger area under the productivity curve due to a ‘momentum bonus’ when compared to completing fewer monolith tasks.

Let’s prove it mathematically.

**Definitions**. Momentum is a mass in motion $p=mv$. Let’s define velocity to be *productivity* and mass to be the *magnitude* of the task being completed.

Momentum is conserved so if two objects $A$ and $B$ collide, elastically, $m_av_a + m_bv_b = m_av_a' + m_bv_b'$ where  $v'$ represents their posterior velocities, respectively. In the inelastic case $m_av_a + m_bv_b = (m_a+m_b)v$ kinetic energy is not conserved and *lost* to the environment. The analogy in the context of productivity is switching from task $A$ to task $B$ after either $A$ has been completed or not. The reason I model context switching as a collision is because it can be classified as elastic or inelastic. Kind of neat.

For a quick refresher:

- Elastic collisions have both momentum and kinetic energy conserved e.g. throwing billiard balls against the edge of a pool table and it comes back just as fast
- Inelastic collisions only have momentum conserved e.g. you trying to push your friend off a cliff (their kinetic energy is converted mostly to friction on the ground)

The coefficient of restitution is designed to quantify collision elasticity

$$
e = \dfrac{v'_b - v_a'}{v_a - v_b}.
$$

The value of $e$  means that

- $e= 0$ is perfectly inelastic
- $0< e < 1$ is real-world inelastic
- $e = 1$ is perfectly elastic
- $e > 1$ occurs in special cases where the collision results in an explosion
- $e = \infin$ when there is a [perfect explosion of a rigid system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_restitution)

Back to productivity.

<ins>Case 1</ins>: You fully completely task $A$ and move onto $B$ (elastic)

Since $m_av_a + m_bv_b = m_av_a' + m_bv_b'$ you’re posterior velocities remain unchanged i.e. you haven’t hit the wall yet. At this point you’ll have the maximum momentum prior to starting task $B$. God speed.

<ins>Case 2</ins>: You don’t fully complete task $A$ and move onto $B$ (inelastic)

This case falls under the condition where $0\le e < 1$ which means your posterior velocity will decrease from loses to the environment hence $m_av_a + m_bv_b = (m_a+m_b)v$. By definition we know that $v \le v_a, v_b$. We can re-arrange to get

$$
v = \dfrac{m_av_a + m_bv_b}{m_a+m_b}.
$$

If we decrease either $m_a$ or $m_b$ whilst increasing $v_a$ or $v_b$ then the final velocity $v$ increases. The real-world analogy is having maximum productivity on the smallest task possible results in a larger final velocity for your next *collision* i.e. task $C$. Unfortunately we don’t live in a world where $v\rightarrow \infin$. Productivity always feels like it tapers at a physical maximum but there are methods of increasing $v_a$ and $v_b$:

- Great sleep
- Physical exercise
- Standing desk
- Frequent breaks
- Deep focus/flow state triggered from deep curiosity

After applying some from this list and some from your own list, the next step is decreasing $m_a$ and $m_b$ to non-zero values. Personally, $m_a = m_b = 0$ equates to holidays. 

We always strive to have our days structured as a sequence of case 1 victories, but reality is much more brutal. I find myself frequently in case 2 territory, but now with a new theoretical framework; a new attack angle.
