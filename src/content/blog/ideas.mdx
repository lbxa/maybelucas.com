description: A list of hard ideas that will need to be solved for humanity to pass through all the great filters - ranked by difficulty. Adding to these as I go.

1. Pursuit of an objective truth
    - As humans we should pursue a maximally objective truth such as the laws of the universe to anchor our technological and societal progress. Not doing so creates a risk of societal regression as was seen in the dark ages.
    - This is harder then it looks, since most information platforms use different flavours of recommendation algorithms targeted at amplifying confirmation bias.
2. Abundance-age philosophy
    - We are currently in the information age, but if humanoids and modular fusion do become a reality in the next 3 decades we could be entering an era of energy and labour abundance.
    - Labour and energy abundance means most humans will have to chose to work if we develop a robust-enough UBI system. Most of the work of Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Nietzsche, Confucius, Rousseau and even Marx needs to be re-visited as we find a new purpose outside of producing labour.
3. Humanoids
    - Specifically a general purpose bipedal robot with prehensile end-effectors that can interface with human world seamlessly - designed to be the new workforce for humanity
    - Robots must build new robots. New robots must build the infrastructure we cannot due to labor shortages. If a robot can built an entirely new robot in just 1 day, then in 30 days we’ll have > 1b robots!
    - The most important use case for humanoids will be in large-scale metropolis construction. The only way to break through 10 billion people is to begin rapidly developing new cities in terraformed land e.g. desert cities, snow cities. Forests should be protected for obvious reasons. Forest cities sound cool though!
4. Morphogenetic software
    - An operating system which can generate an application on the fly and network with other applications or servers. If it can understand user intent it can extend applications with new features in real-time
    - When encountered with process inefficiencies, humans result to automation to speed things up - this is the underlying premise of the multi-billion dollar SaaS industry. However the reality of most problems is that they're very case by case and because of cost-benefit companies and startups can only afford to build general purpose tools they can sell to a broad range of customers. This is a huge contradiction. When companies decline because their software products aren’t keeping up with their dynamic user base, it might just be because they can’t serve such a large audience that broadly.
5. Terraformation
    - The process of infusing infertile land with a abundant fuels and nutrients will be key to housing 100 billion people on Earth
    - Same applies for other planets
    - This process should transform surrounding waste
6. AGI
    - Most likely will come after humanoids - [more on this here](https://maybelucas.com/posts/hippocampus/)
    - Must cure all diseases
    - Extends human knowledge beyond a major extinction event
    - Ideally runs on 20W of power or less to be on-par with the human brain
