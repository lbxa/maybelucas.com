Some things need to be accepted before one can move on. Little things can linger in our brain during our daily tasks which not only impede productivity but result in emotional exhaustion by day's end. 

Firstly, I need to accept my **fear**: letting go of my old toxic self totally. I'm scared because radical change can result in so much discomfort you don't even feel like yourself anymore. I guess that's the point though right? Achieving this begins with how I present myself on the outside, with new clothes, shoes and overall just a refreshed style. Then this can trickle down into internal change in my existing relationships and those not formed yet. Materials don't do shit, they just spark inspiration and creativity. 

Everything that has happened to this point, all my pain, love and perseverance... it's built a cocoon for which a new refined person is being born.

Everything will work out. It has to.
