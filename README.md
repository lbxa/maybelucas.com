## **Hi there** 👋🏼 **!**

I'm Lucas. Currently a third-year student at **UNSW Sydney**. When I'm not coding I'm either slinging drinks 🍹 or surfing the Maroubra rights 🏄🏻. 

## Coding Projects 💻

- [BrainFreeze.org](http://brainfreeze.org) — The HSC's hedge against future pandemics.
- topsecret.com — The Sydney nightlife needs some revitalising.
- UNSW Dreams — A fun lil app we built in CS1531. Took the front-end a bit further.

## Manifesto 📜

### 1. Master the Moment

> Yesterday is history, tomorrow q mystery and today is a gift. That is why it is called the present — Master Oogway
> 

No amount of money ever bought anyone another second of time. Yes, planning for the future and learning about our history is important, but inconsequential to what we choose to do now. So less planning or more doing, after all the only history that will ever matter is the history we make today.

### 2. Knowledge Starts with n

> The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination — Albert Einstein
> 

Having an expansive vocabulary and experience with a subject will make you an expert. Imagination is what will turn you into a trailblazer.
